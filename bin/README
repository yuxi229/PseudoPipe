Pseudopipe can be executed in two steps:

*** Notes and requirements ***

Pseudopipe is designed for running in a unix environment, with Python, Blast and FASTA.
See env.sh for recommended versions of programs and make modification if necessary.
Pseudopipe was originally developed by Zhaolei Zhang and Nicholas Carriero et al.

*** (1) Fetching input data from Ensembl ***

fetchEnsemblFiles.py species_name

Example:

To list the Ensembl FTP and the species available:
fetchEnsemblFiles.py - 

To fetch data for human:
fetchEnsemblFiles.py homo_sapiens

The data will be stored in a directory created for the fetch under the current directory

*** (2) Running Pseudopipe on the fetched data ***

runPpipe.sh [output dir] [config file] [nodes] [queue]

Parameters:
output dir - any writable dir/path, including the fetched dir
config file - config file generated by fetchEnsemblFiles.py under the fetched dir
nodes - e.g. 10. Use 0 if running on the executing node without PBS
queue - e.g. s or mg, as defined in ext/sqPBS.py. Use - if not on PBS

The output will be stored in a 'pgene' dir under the specified output dir.
